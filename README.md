# Ising-Model-Project
Computational physics final project

This is the final project from a computational physics course that I took at Texas A&M in the spring of 2018. The goal of the project was to calculate quantities
of physical interest in the 2d and 3d Ising model. final_project.pdf goes into details on these quantities and their theoretical motivation. Data for the 3d Ising cerromagnet was obtained via ferromagnet_4.cpp (files for other cases no longer exist), and plots were made with gnuplot. Accuracy of the final results was ultimately limited by a lack of available computing power, namely the 
fact that all calculations were run on a laptop that was several years out of date at the time.
